# Alpine Scripts

### Prerequisits

You cant use these scripts right after the alpine installation.

1. You should have set up alpine with the `setup-alpine` command.
2. You shloud have installed the Xorg base with `setup-xorg-base`.

To use the setup script(s) you need to already have `bash` and `curl` installed.
